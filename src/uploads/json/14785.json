The diagnosis of advanced grade 4 osteoarthritis is supported by the plain X-ray findings. The ICD-10 code M17.0 is appropriate for bilateral primary osteoarthritis. The patient was initially treated with non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs and muscle relaxants, showing mild improvement. The current plan involves continuing physiotherapy exercises with a follow-up reassessment in two weeks.",
