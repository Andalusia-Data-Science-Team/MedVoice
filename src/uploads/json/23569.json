The ICD-10 code M17.0 is assigned for bilateral primary osteoarthritis based on the X-ray findings. The history of illness is documented as five years of knee pain with worsening symptoms. Although medications were previously prescribed (NSAIDs and muscle relaxants), there is no indication of current medication. The X-ray results show advanced osteoarthritis. The current plan involves physiotherapy, with a follow-up assessment in two weeks. The assessment is advanced osteoarthritis, grade 4.",
