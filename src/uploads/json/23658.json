  "reasoning": "The patient presents with bilateral knee pain, a chief complaint that has been ongoing for five years and worsened over the past two years. The diagnosis of advanced osteoarthritis grade 4 is supported by the plain X-ray findings, corresponding to ICD-10 code M17.0 for bilateral primary osteoarthritis. The patient was initially treated with non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs and muscle relaxants, which resulted in mild improvement. The current plan involves physiotherapy exercises, with a follow-up reassessment scheduled for two weeks later to evaluate the effectiveness of the treatment and potentially adjust the management plan.",
