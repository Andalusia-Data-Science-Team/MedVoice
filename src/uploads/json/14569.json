  "reasoning": "The patient's chief complaint is bilateral knee pain, which has been ongoing for five years and worsened two years ago. The diagnosis of advanced grade 4 osteoarthritis is supported by the plain X-ray results. The ICD-10 code M17.0 is appropriate for bilateral primary osteoarthritis. The patient was treated with non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs and muscle relaxants, which resulted in mild improvement. The current plan involves continuing physiotherapy exercises, with a follow-up assessment in two weeks to monitor progress.",
