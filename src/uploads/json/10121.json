  "reasoning": "The patient presents with bilateral knee pain, a chief complaint that has been ongoing for five years and worsened two years ago. The diagnosis of advanced grade 4 osteoarthritis is supported by the plain X-ray findings. ICD-10 code M17.0 is appropriate for bilateral primary osteoarthritis. The patient was initially treated with non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs and muscle relaxants, which resulted in mild improvement. The current plan involves physiotherapy exercises, with a follow-up reassessment scheduled for two weeks later.",
